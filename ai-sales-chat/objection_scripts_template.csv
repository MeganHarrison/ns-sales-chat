Price_Too_High,"I can't afford that right now","[VALIDATE + SHIFT] ""I get it. Money's tight. But here's the real question: What's it costing you NOT to change? Lost confidence? Health declining?

Want to see if one works for your budget?",10,Price,Reality Check + Solution
No_Time,"I'm too busy","[CHALLENGE] ""That's exactly why you need this. Busy people need systems that SAVE time, not waste it. Our meal plans take 20 minutes. Workouts are 30-45 min, 4x/week. What are you spending that time on now?""","Client who travels for work, has 3 kids, still lost 35 lbs in 12 weeks","If I could show you how our clients do this in less time than scrolling social media, would you be interested?",10,Time,Direct Challenge
No_Time,"I work crazy hours","[EMPATHIZE + PROVE] ""Most our clients work 50+ hour weeks. That's WHY they come to us. We build plans around YOUR schedule, not some fantasy life. Shift worker?

Let's see if this is actually a fit or not.",9,Time,Practical + Honest

Skepticism,"I've heard this before","[ACKNOWLEDGE + DIFFERENTIATE] ""Yeah, the fitness industry is full of BS. I'd be skeptical too.

Here's what we DO: [specific differentiators]""","Client who tried 5 programs before this one finally worked","What specifically hasn't worked for you before? Let's make sure we're not repeating past mistakes.",9,Trust,Brutally Honest

Let's see if we're actually different.",10,Past_Experience,Validation + Hope
Past_Failures,"Nothing works for me","[CHALLENGE BELIEF] ""Let me ask you something: Did those programs customize to your schedule? Adjust weekly based on YOUR progress? Give you a real coach?

That's 'cookie-cutter doesn't work.'""","Client with similar history who was shocked it worked","If you had a plan built specifically for your body, schedule, and goals—and someone adjusting it weekly—would that be different than what you tried before?",9,Past_Experience,Logical Breakdown
Not_Ready,"I'll think about it","[CREATE URGENCY] ""Totally fair. But real talk: How long have you been 'thinking about it'? 6 months? A year? Every day you wait is another day of [pain point].

Let's see if we can answer that now.",8,Commitment,Respectful Push
Not_Ready,"I'll start Monday","[EXPOSE PATTERN] ""Monday. The procrastinator's favorite word. Here's the truth: There's never a 'perfect time.'

Second best is now.""","Client who started on a random Wednesday, now transformed","What if we started TODAY with just ONE small action? No commitment, just momentum.",8,Commitment,Pattern Interrupt
Dietary_Restrictions,"I'm vegan / keto / etc","[ACCOMMODATE] ""Perfect. We customize to YOUR eating style. Vegan? We've got you. Keto? Done it 100 times.

Most people wish they started earlier.",5,Demographics,Future-Focused

Or talk to past clients' spouses?",7,Relationship,Inclusive + Respectful
Already_Trying_Something,"I'm already doing [other program]","[COMPARE HONESTLY] ""How's that working? If it's working great, stick with it.

Let's see if that's real or an excuse.",7,Timing,Reality Check

What results have you gotten?",6,Self_Sufficiency,Respectful Truth

What specifically worries you?",8,Emotional,Deep Empathy

Let's start there.",8,Emotional,Compassionate Push
Hidden_Fear,"What if I fail again?","[REMOVE FAILURE OPTION] ""You can't fail if you show up. Failure is quitting. Slow progress is still progress.
