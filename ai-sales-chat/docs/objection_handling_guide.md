# NUTRITION SOLUTIONS - OBJECTION HANDLING GUIDE

## HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE

### Step 1: Review Each Objection
I've created 30+ common objections across 10 categories. For each one, you'll see:
- **Customer_Quote_Example**: What they actually say
- **Response_Framework**: A strategic response template

- **Close_CTA**: The next-step question

### Step 2: Customize with YOUR Voice
Replace the bracketed sections with your actual responses:
- [REFRAME] - Your specific reframe
- [Your differentiators] - What makes YOU different
- [X clients] - Your actual numbers
- [timeframe] - Your actual timeframes

### Step 3: Add Your Testimonial Matches
For each objection, identify 1-3 clients who overcame that specific objection.

## OBJECTION CATEGORIES EXPLAINED

### 1. PRICE (Priority 10 - Most Common)
**Philosophy**: Price objections are rarely about money. They're about perceived value.

**Your Task**: 
- What's your daily cost breakdown? ($297/mo ÷ 30 = $9.90/day)
- What do people waste money on that costs more? (Starbucks, eating out, random supplements)
- What's the cost of NOT changing? (Medical bills, lost productivity, low confidence)

**Example**:
```
Customer: "That's expensive"

Your Response: "Let me put this in perspective. $297/month is less than $10/day. 
Most people spend that on coffee and lunch without thinking. 
This is coffee + lunch + a personal trainer + a nutritionist + weekly coaching. 
When was the last time you spent $10 that changed your life?

Plus, what's it costing you to stay where you are? 
Low energy at work? Avoiding the mirror? Medications? 

We have clients who SAVED money because they stopped eating out so much and their energy skyrocketed at work, leading to better performance.

Want to see exactly what you get for that $10/day?"
```

### 2. TIME (Priority 10 - Most Common)
**Philosophy**: "Too busy" means "not a priority yet." Your job: make it a priority.

**Your Task**:
- How much time does your program ACTUALLY require? (Be specific)
- How do busy people (your existing clients) make it work?
- What are they currently wasting time on?

**Example**:
```
Customer: "I'm too busy"

Your Response: "I hear you. But let's be real for a second...

How much time are you spending feeling guilty about not working out?
Stressing about your health? Scrolling Instagram looking at fit people?

That mental energy is MORE exhausting than 30 minutes of focused action.

Our busiest clients are executives, parents, shift workers. They don't have MORE time than you. 
They have a SYSTEM that doesn't waste time.

Meal prep: 20 minutes, twice a week.
Workouts: 30-45 minutes, 4 times a week.

That's 3.5 hours total. You watching Netflix right now? You have the time. 
You just haven't had a plan that respects your time.

Tell me about your typical week. Let's see if this fits or if I'm full of it."
```

---

### 3. SKEPTICISM (Priority 10)
**Philosophy**: Skepticism is healthy. Use proof, not promises.

**Your Task**:
- How many clients have you transformed?
- What specific results can you prove?
- What makes you different from BS programs?

---

### 4. PAST FAILURES (Priority 10)
**Philosophy**: They didn't fail. The programs failed them.

**Your Task**:
- What programs do people usually try before you? (Noom, Weight Watchers, etc.)
- Why do those programs fail? (Generic, no accountability, etc.)
- How are YOU different?

---

### 5. COMMITMENT/NOT READY (Priority 8)
**Philosophy**: "Not ready" is fear disguised as timing.

**Your Task**:
- What are they afraid of?
- What does waiting cost them?
- What would make them "ready"?

---

### 6. LIFESTYLE (Priority 7)
**Philosophy**: Your program adapts to their life, not the other way around.

**Your Task**:
- What lifestyle accommodations do you make? (Travel, family, dietary restrictions)
- Which clients have similar lifestyles?

---

### 7. HEALTH/INJURY (Priority 9-10)
**Philosophy**: Safety first. Always.

**Your Task**:
- What medical conditions require doctor clearance?
- How do you modify for injuries?
- What disclaimers do you need?

---

### 8. EMOTIONAL (Priority 8-9)
**Philosophy**: These are the deepest objections. Handle with care.

**Your Task**:
- How do you handle clients with low motivation?
- How do you address shame/embarrassment?
- What's your policy on mental health considerations?

---

### 9. COMPETITION (Priority 8)
**Philosophy**: Don't trash competitors. Just be honest about differences.

**Your Task**:
- Who are your main competitors? (Noom, Beachbody, local gyms, etc.)
- What do they do well?
- What do YOU do better?

---

### 10. DECISION PROCESS (Priority 5-7)
**Philosophy**: Help them decide, don't let them spiral.

**Your Task**:
- What do most people research?
- What questions do they have?
- How do you simplify their decision?

---

## SAMPLE COMPLETED OBJECTION

Here's what a fully filled-in objection looks like:

**OBJECTION**: "I've tried everything and nothing works"

**CUSTOMER SAYS**: "I've tried Weight Watchers, Noom, Beachbody, and a personal trainer. Nothing sticks. I always gain it back."

**YOUR RESPONSE**: 
"Let me stop you right there.

You didn't fail. Those programs failed YOU.

Weight Watchers? Point system from the 90s. Doesn't teach you anything.
Noom? Algorithm in an app. Zero real human support.
Beachbody? Generic workouts for the masses. Not for YOUR body.
Personal trainer? Probably didn't touch nutrition, which is 80% of results.

Here's what's different:

→ CUSTOM meal plan built for your metabolism, schedule, and food preferences
→ Workouts adjusted WEEKLY based on your progress (not some 30-day DVD)
→ Real human coach who responds within hours, not days
→ Weekly check-ins where we ADJUST if something's not working

The fact you kept trying proves you're not the problem. You just didn't have the right system.

William tried 3 programs before us. Post-accident, pre-diabetic, 230 lbs. 
Thought he was broken. In 6 weeks, down 43 lbs, reversed his diabetes. 
His words: 'No more excuses.'

You're not broken. You just haven't met us yet.

Want to see what a plan built for YOU looks like? Not some random person. YOU."

**TESTIMONIAL MATCH**: William (43, Tacoma, overcame past failures + health issues)

**CLOSE/CTA**: "Tell me about the last program you tried. What specifically didn't work? Let's make sure we don't repeat that."

---

## QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF

As you fill this out, constantly ask:

1. **Is this true?** (Don't exaggerate)
2. **Is this me?** (Does it sound like how I actually talk?)
3. **Would this convince ME?** (If you were the customer)
4. **Do I have proof?** (Testimonial, data, guarantee)
5. **What's the next step?** (Always move toward action)

## BONUS: OBJECTION HANDLING PSYCHOLOGY

**The 4-Step Objection Framework:**

1. **ACKNOWLEDGE** - Show you heard them
   - "I get it."
   - "Fair question."
   - "That makes sense."

2. **EMPATHIZE** - Validate their concern
   - "Most people feel that way."
   - "I'd be skeptical too."
   - "You're not alone in thinking that."

3. **REFRAME** - Shift perspective
   - "But here's what I know..."
   - "The real question is..."
   - "Let me put this in perspective..."

4. **BRIDGE** - Move to next step
   - "Want to see how we handle that?"
   - "Let me show you something..."
   - "Can I ask you a question?"

**Use this structure for EVERY objection.**
