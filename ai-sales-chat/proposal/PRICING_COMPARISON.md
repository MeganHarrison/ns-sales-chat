## CUSTOM HYBRID OPTIONS

### Hybrid A: "Lower Upfront Performance"
```
Upfront:        $10,000 (lower barrier)
Months 1-6:     $1,500/month (extended monitoring)
Months 7+:      Performance tiers (same as Option 1)
Cap:            $8,000/month maximum
```
**Best for**: Even more risk-averse clients

### Hybrid B: "Rev Share with Floor/Ceiling"
```
Upfront:        $18,000
Monthly:        8% of AI value, minimum $2,000, maximum $8,000
```
**Best for**: Predictability + performance balance

### Hybrid C: "Flat Fee Lite"
```
Upfront:        $20,000
Monthly:        $3,500/month fixed
Bonuses:        Same as Option 3
```
**Best for**: Predictability but lower monthly commitment

---

## MY FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**Option 1 (Performance-Based) is the best choice because:**

1. **Lowest risk for you**: Only $21K in the first 3 months
2. **Clear proof period**: 3 months to see if it works before major fees
3. **Aligned incentives**: I make more only when you make more
4. **Transparent methodology**: Attribution is clear and adjustable
5. **Industry standard**: ~10% of value created is fair
6. **Best ROI in conservative scenario**: 7x vs 3.9x (Option 3)
7. **Protects both parties**: You don't overpay, I don't undercharge

**The numbers speak for themselves**:
- Break-even in Month 2 (only need 2.4 customers)
- 7-12x ROI in Year 1 (across all scenarios)
- If it doesn't work, you're only out $21K
- If it works, you capture $367K-$1.5M in incremental value

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Review all three options**
2. **Identify which risk profile fits your comfort level**
3. **Consider if a custom hybrid makes more sense**
4. **Let's schedule a call to walk through the attribution methodology**
5. **Address any concerns or questions**

**The real question isn't which pricing model to choose.**

**The real question is: Can you afford NOT to implement this?**

Every month you delay = $30K-$75K in lost CLV opportunity.

Let's stop the leak and start capturing that value.
