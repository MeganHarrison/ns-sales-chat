INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
1. Update "Total Orders" column monthly with actual WooCommerce order count
2. "Baseline Orders" auto-updates as rolling 6-month average (before AI launch)
3. "Raw Lift" = Total Orders - Baseline Orders
4. Track "Ad Spend % Change" - if >30% increase that month adjust attribution down
5. "Seasonal Adjustment" = compare to same month prior year if significant variance
6. "Campaign Active" = Yes/No for major marketing campaigns (exclude those weeks)
7. "Attribution %" starts at 50% conservative can increase to 70% with confidence
8. "AI Attributed Orders" = Raw Lift × Attribution % (after adjustments)
9. "Monthly AI Value" = AI Attributed Orders × $1800 CLV
10. "Monthly Fee" determined by tier based on AI Attributed Orders
11. ROI = Cumulative AI Value ÷ Cumulative Fees

ATTRIBUTION ADJUSTMENT EXAMPLES:
- Ad spend increased 50% this month → Reduce attribution to 35% that month
- Major sale/campaign running → Exclude those weeks set attribution to 0%
- January (historically 20% above average) → Reduce raw lift by 20% before attribution
- Multiple factors → Stack adjustments multiplicatively

TIER REFERENCE:
0-10 orders = $2000/month
11-20 orders = $3500/month
21-30 orders = $5000/month
31-40 orders = $7000/month
41+ orders = $10000/month

BONUS TRIGGERS:
15%+ conversion lift = +$2000 bonus that month
20%+ conversion lift = +$5000 bonus that month
