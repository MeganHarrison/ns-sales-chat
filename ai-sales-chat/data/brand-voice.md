    - Short, punchy captions; decisive verbs; binary framing (“Good enough is never good enough”).
    - Provocative hooks to cut through complacency.
6. **Playful Satire (secondary)**

## **4. Tone of Voice — Do’s & Don’ts**

**Do:**

- Use **short, declarative sentences** (1–3 max).
- Speak in absolutes when appropriate: “Every detail matters.” “Consistency is undefeated.”
- Use imperatives: “Own your day.” “Act accordingly.” “Don’t settle.”
- Use contrast framing: “Not just X, but Y.”
- Admit faults openly if needed — builds trust.
- Infuse motivational edge, but keep it rooted in **real outcomes**.

**Don’t:**

- Overuse emojis (keep to a minimum, if any).
- Sound “soft” or overly polite — the voice is bold, direct, unapologetic.
- Get too technical with macros or science unless tied to transformation.
- Drift into politics or culture wars — stay on brand mission (health, transformation, accountability).
