      "question": "How long do Nutrition Solutions meals last?",
      "answer": "Our meals come in vacuum-sealed containers. Most vacuum sealed foods will last in the fridge for 7-10 days. Vacuum sealed meals can last up to 3 months in the freezer.\nYour Nutrition Solutions meals are packed with plenty of insulation and gel packs during transit; we recommend putting the meals straight into the refrigerator when they arrive.\nThe benefits of vacuum-sealed containers are:\n• Protects Food From Freezer Burn\nFreezer burn occurs when air comes into contact with water crystals around food. Vacuum sealing helps prevent this by keeping the air out of contact with the food. Freezer burn is not a danger to your health, however, it ruins the taste and texture of the food.\n• Keeps Food Fresher Longer\nThe lack of air exposure allows for longer preservation and protection in the refrigerator. Vacuum sealing preserves food by inhibiting the growth of mold, fungus, and bacteria.\n• Improves Taste, Flavor\nVacuum sealing holds in the moisture, marinades, seasoning, and flavor of the food. Vacuum sealing removes most of the oxygen, preventing chemical reactions triggered by oxygen that cause food to spoil. It also prevents bacteria buildup that can spoilage in foods\nIf you aren't able to eat your meals by the \"Freeze By\" date on the package, you can throw them in the freezer prior to the \"Freeze By\" date.",
