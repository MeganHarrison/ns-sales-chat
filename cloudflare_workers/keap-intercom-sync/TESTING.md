# Testing the Intercom ‚Üí Keap Sync

## How to Verify the Sync is Working

### Method 1: Automated Test Script

Use the provided test script to verify end-to-end functionality:

```bash
# Set required environment variables
export WORKER_URL="https://your-worker.workers.dev"
export INTERCOM_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_intercom_token"

# Run the test
node test-sync.js
```

**What the test does:**
1. Sends a mock Intercom webhook to your worker
2. Waits for the sync to complete
3. Queries Intercom to verify the `external_id` was set
4. Reports success or failure

**Expected output:**
```
‚úÖ SUCCESS: external_id is set to Keap contact ID: 12345
üéâ Test passed! The sync is working correctly.
```

### Method 2: Manual Testing with Real Intercom User

1. **Create a test user in Intercom:**
   - Go to Intercom dashboard
   - Create a new contact with a test email (e.g., `test@example.com`)

2. **Check Worker Logs:**
   ```bash
   cd cloudflare_workers/keap-intercom-sync
   wrangler tail
   ```

   Look for these log messages:
   ```
   Intercom webhook received: { topic: 'contact.created', ... }
   Processing Intercom contact test-contact-123
   Searching for contact with email test@example.com in Keap
   Creating new Keap contact for test@example.com
   Linking Intercom contact test-contact-123 with Keap contact 456
   ‚úÖ Successfully linked! Intercom external_id is now: 456
   ```

3. **Verify in Intercom:**

   Query the Intercom API to check the `external_id`:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://api.intercom.io/contacts/search \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_INTERCOM_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Intercom-Version: 2.11" \
     -d '{
       "query": {
         "field": "email",
         "operator": "=",
         "value": "test@example.com"
       }
     }' | jq '.data[0].external_id'
   ```

   **Expected result:** The Keap contact ID (e.g., `"456"`)

4. **Verify in Keap:**

   Check that the contact exists in Keap:
   ```bash
   curl https://api.infusionsoft.com/crm/rest/v1/contacts/456 \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEAP_TOKEN"
   ```

### Method 3: Check Supabase Sync Logs

Query the sync logs table:

```sql
SELECT
  keap_contact_id,
  intercom_contact_id,
  sync_status,
  sync_direction,
  synced_at,
  error_message
FROM keap_intercom_sync_logs
WHERE sync_direction = 'intercom_to_keap'
ORDER BY synced_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected result:**
```
keap_contact_id | intercom_contact_id  | sync_status | sync_direction
456             | test-contact-123     | synced      | intercom_to_keap
```

## Verifying External ID is Set

The most important check is confirming the `external_id` in Intercom:

### Using Intercom API

```bash
# Get contact by email
curl -X POST https://api.intercom.io/contacts/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_INTERCOM_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Intercom-Version: 2.11" \
  -d '{
    "query": {
      "field": "email",
      "operator": "=",
      "value": "user@example.com"
    }
  }'
```

Look for this in the response:
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "contact-abc123",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "external_id": "456",  // ‚Üê This should be the Keap contact ID
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

### Using Intercom Dashboard

1. Go to Intercom ‚Üí Contacts
2. Search for the test contact
3. View the contact details
4. The external ID should be visible in the contact's attributes

## Troubleshooting

### External ID is NULL

**Problem:** The `external_id` field is not being set in Intercom.

**Possible causes:**
1. Intercom API token doesn't have `contacts:write` permission
2. The contact role is not set to 'user' (required for external_id)
3. The `linkKeapContact()` call is failing silently

**How to debug:**
```bash
# Check worker logs for errors
wrangler tail

# Look for this specific log message:
# "‚úÖ Successfully linked! Intercom external_id is now: XXX"
```

### Sync Status is 'failed' in Supabase

**Problem:** Sync is failing but you don't know why.

**Solution:**
Check the `error_message` column:
```sql
SELECT error_message, synced_at
FROM keap_intercom_sync_logs
WHERE sync_status = 'failed'
ORDER BY synced_at DESC;
```

### No Webhook Events Received

**Problem:** Worker isn't receiving Intercom webhooks.

**Solution:**
1. Verify webhook is configured in Intercom dashboard
2. Check webhook URL is correct: `https://your-worker.workers.dev/webhook/intercom`
3. Test manually with curl:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/webhook/intercom \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"type":"notification_event","topic":"contact.created",...}'
   ```

## Success Criteria

The sync is working correctly when:

- ‚úÖ Worker receives Intercom webhooks (`200 OK` response)
- ‚úÖ Contacts are created/updated in Keap
- ‚úÖ Intercom contact's `external_id` is set to the Keap contact ID
- ‚úÖ Supabase logs show `sync_status = 'synced'` and `sync_direction = 'intercom_to_keap'`
- ‚úÖ Worker logs show: `‚úÖ Successfully linked! Intercom external_id is now: XXX`
