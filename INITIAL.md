## FEATURE:

Create a two-way sync between Supabase and Keap CRM.

This feature enables automatic, bi-directional synchronization of data between Keap CRM and Supabase.Including: 
- contacts
- orders
- tags
- subscriptions

The synchronized data will be visualized via charts and dashboards in a secure Next.js web app, enabling real-time insights and interactive reporting for business decision-making.

**Use Case:** The main goal is to unlock advanced analytics and AI agent capabilities by consolidating Keap data into a Supabase schema, which serves as a flexible data lake for downstream tasks such as:
  - Customer lifetime value analysis
  - Churn prediction
  - Segmentation and cohort tracking
  - KPI dashboards (retention, reactivation, engagement scores)
  - Trigger-based workflows
  - Marketing attribution

- **Dashboard Visualization via Next.js:**
  - A Next.js web application will serve as the frontend for visualizing Supabase data.
  - Graphs and charts will be dynamically rendered using libraries such as Recharts, Chart.js, or Visx.
  - Authentication via Supabase Auth or NextAuth will ensure secure access.
  - Admin users will be able to track trends over time, compare performance by tags, and drill into individual customer journeys.

- **AI Agent Integration:**
  - The two-way sync unlocks AI use cases such as:
    - Natural language dashboards (e.g., “What’s the average CLV of active clients?”)
    - Predictive tagging (“Which leads are most likely to convert?”)
    - Automated outreach or campaign suggestions based on Supabase triggers

- RAG Chat

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- **Authentication:** Consider using PATs (Personal Access Tokens) for Keap for server-to-server tasks or implement OAuth with refresh tokens for multi-user scenarios.

- **Supabase Schema Design:** 
  - Tables: `contacts`, `orders`, `tags`, `interactions`, `sync_log`
  - Columns: include `keap_id`, `supabase_id`, `last_synced_at`, `sync_status`, `source_of_truth`

- **Conflict Resolution Strategy:**
  - Store a `last_modified_by` and `last_updated_at` field in both systems.
  - Establish a primary source of truth per data field or table.
  - Optionally build a manual override log.

- **Webhook Support:**
  - Keap supports some event triggers via API but may require polling for full coverage.
  - Supabase can be enhanced with RLS or trigger-based functions to capture changes for outbound sync.

- **Rate Limits and Throttling:**
  - Keap’s API has limits; batch requests and backoff strategies must be implemented.
  - Use queues or scheduled jobs to manage large-scale syncs.

- **Security:**
  - All secrets (Keap tokens, Supabase service role keys) should be stored in secure edge environments (Cloudflare, Vercel, etc.) and never exposed to clients.
  - Role-based access for frontend clients should be scoped tightly to read-only operations.

- **Future Extensions:**
  - Add syncing for custom fields and forms.
  - Integrate email engagement data for richer segmentation.
  - Connect to external systems (e.g., Stripe, Notion, or Google Sheets) for a unified view.
  - Trigger Keap campaigns directly from actions in the dashboard.
